# AI-Powered-Card-Issuance-Tool
This project focuses on predicting the type of bank card a customer might choose using machine learning. By training a Random Forest Classifier with real-world card usage data, weâ€™ve created a smart prediction model. The model is integrated into a user-friendly web app built with Django and deployed on Heroku, making it accessible and easy to use.
